**Quality drop rate**
*All quality will be based on the drop color.*
- White: Primitive quality.
- Green: Ramshackle quality.
- Purple: Journeyman quality.
- Yellow: Mastercraft quality.
- Red: Ascendant quality.

*Please note that the quality is not 100% guaranteed based on the quality of the drop. For example, a red drop does not mean all drops are ascendants; there is a chance some of them are mastercraft or lower. We don't have full control over these quality drop chances; this is embedded in the game itself, so we can't do anything about it. But we make sure it is adjusted to the highest quality possible.*
